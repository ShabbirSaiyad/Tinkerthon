⭐⭐ Bridge Gap - A Digital Translator ⭐⭐

🚀 Problem Statement 🚀
To Create a digital translator for Indian voices, transforming spoken Hindi, Indian English, Urdu, Bengali, and Punjabi into text using 
native scripts, then rendering them into multiple languages.

🚀 Solution 🚀
Our Solution "Bridge Gap" seeks to reduce the linguistic barrier. We developed the Bridge-Gap website in response to urgent problems that many people
, including tourists, rural dwellers, and students, were facing.

👉 Our Bridge Gap solution used the Web Speech Javascript API, which supported several languages, for the initial speech-to-text conversion. We then included
an external translation API to close the language gap. In the end, the Speech Synthesis interface provided by the Web Speech API allowed users to hear 
the translated  text.

👉 Our project does more than convert speech to text. Images can include text that can be retrieved and translated into whatever language you need. This functionality uses the powerful JavaScript library Tesseract.js for multilingual OCR (Optical Character Recognition). It's important to remember that, despite Tesseract.js's many advantages, its accuracy could not always be as good as the Google Translate API.

👉 To reduce this potential gap, a text-to-speech synthesis tool was part of our approach. This allows users to hear the text that has been extracted in any language. Users can ensure a more accurate translation experience by actively listening to identify and fix any errors that may have occurred during the text extraction process from photos.
