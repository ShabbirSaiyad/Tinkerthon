Bridge Gap - A Digital Translator

Problem Statement: Create a digital translator for Indian voices, transforming spoken Hindi, Indian English, Urdu, Bengali, and Punjabi into text using 
native scripts, then rendering them into multiple languages.

Solution:
Our Solution "Bridge Gap" seeks to reduce the linguistic barrier. We developed the Bridge-Gap website in response to urgent problems that many people
,including tourists, rural dwellers, and students, were facing.

Our Bridge Gap solution used the Web Speech Javascript API, which supported several languages, for the initial speech-to-text conversion. We then included
an external translation API to close the language gap. In the end,the Speech Synthesis interface provided by the Web Speech API allowed users to hear 
the translated  text.

Technology Used: HTML, CSS and Javascript
